# Anti-Drunk Driving Car Safety System

This project is an anti-drunk driving car safety system developed using an Arduino Uno board, alcohol sensor, buzzer, and relay module. The system is designed to detect alcohol levels in the driver and automatically stop the vehicle if a drunk driver attempts to operate it.

## Components Used
- Arduino Uno board
- Alcohol sensor
- Buzzer
- Relay module
- bread board
- wire and led
## How It Works
1. The alcohol sensor continuously monitors the alcohol levels in the vicinity of the driver.
2. If alcohol is detected above a certain threshold, the buzzer is triggered to alert the driver.
3. Simultaneously, the relay module is activated to cut off the power supply to the vehicle's engine, automatically stopping the car.

## Getting Started
To replicate this project, you will need an Arduino Uno board and the necessary components listed above. Follow these steps:

1. Connect the alcohol sensor, buzzer, and relay module to the Arduino Uno board as per the circuit diagram provided in the repository.
2. Install the Arduino IDE software on your computer and open the code file (`drunk_driving_car_safety_system.ino`) using the IDE.
3. Upload the code to the Arduino Uno board.
4. Make sure all the components are connected properly and securely.
5. Power up the Arduino board.
6. Test the system by simulating alcohol presence near the sensor. The buzzer should sound, and the vehicle should automatically stop.
